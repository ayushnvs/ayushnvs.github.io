        <p>Hello friends, My name is Ayush Mishra. Probably, you 
            haven't have visited any site like this one, in the sense,
        having no design or creativity in the structure of the website.
    It is so because I am not using someone else's template rather
I am learning and creating one Myself. I started learning HTML on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">freecodecamp</a> which seem
to be a great platform for learning html as well as other topics related to programming.</p>
        <p>If you want to contact or follow me on different social meadia,
          I am providing the link for the same below:
